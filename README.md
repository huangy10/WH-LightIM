# WH-LightIM
Light-weighted Instance Messaging Solution

## About This Project

This project is motivated by an iOS app I developed last year, where I need to implement instance messaging (IM) function. I tried xmpp and it is really annoying to use. At last, I wrote an IM by myself, both server side and client side. After delivering the app, I think it's time to start an opensource project to improve this IM module just in case the I will use it again. If you're interested, feel free to use it.
